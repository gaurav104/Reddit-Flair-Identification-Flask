    "## Removing Stopwords\n",
    "Stopwords are typically useless words and do not add much meaning to a sentence. In the English language common stopwords include “you, he, she, in, a, has, are, etc.”. First, we need to import the NLTK stopwords library and set our stopwords to “english”. We are going to add a new column “no_stopwords” which will remove the stopwords from the “no_punc” column since it has been tokenized, had been converted to lowercase and punctuation was removed. Once again a for-loop within a lambda function will iterate over the tokens in “no_punc” and only return the tokens which do no exist in our “stop_words” variable.\n",

    "## Lemmatization\n",
    "The idea of stemming is to reduce different forms of word usage into its root word. For example, “drive”, “drove”, “driving”, “driven”, “driver” are derivatives of the word “drive” and very often researchers want to remove this variability from their corpus. Compared to lemmatization, stemming is certainly the less complicated method but it often does not produce a dictionary-specific morphological root of the word. In other words, stemming the word “pies” will often produce a root of “pi” whereas lemmatization will find the morphological root of “pie”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of taking the easy way out with stemming, let’s apply lemmatization to our data as it requires some additional steps compared to stemming.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have to apply parts of speech tags, in other words, determine the part of speech (ie. noun, verb, adverb, etc.) for each word."
